                    <p>That's where I came in. bumpcall's goal was to change communication by turning "bumps on the street" to five-minute FaceTime calls. The founders realized that there was a need to change the way we talk, to decrease the looming anxiety of waiting for texts and not knowing when to call. Through the pandemic, bumpcall was born. Joining bumpcall early on, I made the most of my knowledge from hackathon and designathon competitions and saw this as an opportunity to put my UI/UX design skills to work through countless iterations.</p>

                <div class="cs_content_text">
                    <p>As one of two interns for a startup, I took on a big position as someone who would make significant design decisions. Weekly, we would discuss with one of the cofounders and run through new iterations of pieces of the app we designed. Given that the mobile app only had a few iterations of the MVP to begin with, I was able to design numerous pages, states, components, and iterations of the product. As my junior spring semester came to a close, I was brought on as Director of Product Design briefly to continue my work with the designs before finally parting ways.</p>

                    <p>With only a few prototyped screens ranging from opening the app to "bumping into someone", my job as an intern was to <b>redesign the entire app</b>. Researching the psychology and cognitive processes of friendships, of reaching out to someone in-person and digitally, and of running into someone, our solution was to bring new life to the product with new colors, new interactions, and new conversations.</p>

                    <h4 class="h4sub">Texting is hard — you don't want to spam but seeing that iMessage bubble or read receipt is stressful — and spontaneously calling/FaceTiming isn't any easier.</h4>
                    <p>Being left on read, misinterpreting a message, coming off as needy, admitting to ourselves we don't communicate as much as we feel we should, not knowing what to talk about... so many factors can come into play nowadays. <a href="https://thekeep.eiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3185&context=theses">Correlational analysis</a> on the relationships between text messaging and social psychology shows a significant negative relationship between self-perception of text message dependancy and self-esteem. Similarly, the study shows a positively linked correlation between text messaging and social anxiety.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With most folks, especially young adults in school or college, on their electronic devices for more than 5 hours a day during the pandemic, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617723376">study</a> shows that 48 percent of teens spending at least five hours per day on an electronic device have at least one suicide risk factor. The short story is that it's complicated, but an attachment to our devices has led to a digital "FOMO", or fear of missing out, and we see it in texting, messaging, etc.</p>

                    <p>Born out of boredom, bumpcall aims to address the consistent and ever-growing anxiety of digital communication. As an ambitious, enthusiastic, and young user experience designer, bumpcall was <b>my first opportunity into the industry as an intern</b>. At first, I felt like there was a lot riding on this, even though it was <i>unpaid</i>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond my personal desires and challenges, some initial challenges with bumpcall was the disagreement of what the bumpcall brand was to become. There was simply <b>an overwhelming amount of orange and the wireframe designs felt a bit dated</b>, so communicating suggestions for redesigns was met with resistance by the lead Product Designer who was one of the co-founders. While neither of us had formal design experience, I had collections of past designs from competitions to justify my ideas and eventually meet in the middle with the co-founder.</p>

                <div class="cs_content_text">
                    <p>Upon onboarding and discussing the purpose of the product, it came to my mind that bumpcall would best serve the <b>college student population</b>, followed by students in general. This young demographic would be best suited to pitch bumpcall to because of students' daily interactions with each other, seeing each other on campus, in the hallways, libraries, dining halls, study lounges, on the sidewalks, etc. Given that isolation due to COVID-19 was one of the factors that gave rise to bumpcall, students have been one of the most impacted demographics with classes being held virtually and most colleges and universities opting out of reopening campus.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The premise of bumpcall is to bridge this loss of social interaction and communication via a spontaneous 5-minute video call to imitate that face-to-face coincidental meetup. I find that bumpcall's <b>"bump"</b> feature best fits the student culture and atmosphere due to the frequency and carefree nature of those in real-life interactions. Bumping on bumpcall is a social interaction, not a business meeting.</p>

                    <p>While I understood that the co-founders had done their research, I still didn't understand a few things that made this product stand out. The initiative was a great idea, but I wondered how this was in market demand.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"What made this different from sporadically calling or FaceTiming my friends?"</i></p>
                    <p><i>"There's so many messaging platforms so are we entering a saturated market head-on?"</i></p>
                    <p><i>"Is it possible to hit the bump and just not bump into anyone?"</i></p>

                    <p>Accumulating my research together, I drafted some <i>"How might we..."</i> statements to drive the project in the right direction.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"How might we differentiate ourselves from FaceTime?"</i></p>
                    <p><i>"How might we connect more people together who might not be the best of friends?"</i></p>
                    <p><i>"How might we invite more users to the product or get users to share with friends?"</i></p>

                    <p>When mapping out the user flow of the different routes one might take with bumpcall, it came to our attention that, like introverts and extroverts, <b>we would have users who will be making the calls and users who would receive the calls</b>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This distinction became exceptionally clear when the initial prototype had a plain spinning circle upon hitting the <b>bump button</b> in the middle. Users initiating the bump were told that they wait between 20 seconds to several minutes. That is a prime opportunity to make the most out of, but should be limited given that the wait is so variable.</p>

                    <p>From previous experience, I learned that a landing page is the biggest bottleneck to retaining a user. As the user scrolls down, the website unfolds the story behind the Ambassadors. From a call for community to personal anecdotes, each section emphasizes a collective mindset using the "Our..." pronoun.</p>

                    <p>I'm a proud user of <a href="https://storyset.com/">Storyset</a> graphics. The range of artstyles is very versatile and it adds a lot of flavor to what could simply be an informative hero page. With a relevant graphic to accompany the content, users would find more interest browsing.</p>

Below are the final implementations of each main page (excluding the landing page seen above)!</p>

                    <p>This project was certainly a lot different from the ones I tackled before because I had the job of fully designing and developing the product. I learned to value <b>the compromises between ideation and feasible design</b>. While I wish my teammates could put as much effort in as I did, I learned a lot about what I could manage and what I excel at.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The next step is to collaborate with the Ambassadors to get the website up and running on their end. It was an absolute pleasure spending countless hours night after night to not only get a finished product turned in, but a clean, polished redesign that accounted for as many factors as possible.</p>
