                    <p>That's where I came in. bumpcall's goal was to change communication by turning "bumps on the street" to five-minute FaceTime calls. The founders realized that there was a need to change the way we talk, to decrease the looming anxiety of waiting for texts and not knowing when to call. Through the pandemic, bumpcall was born. Joining bumpcall early on, I made the most of my knowledge from hackathon and designathon competitions and saw this as an opportunity to put my UI/UX design skills to work through countless iterations.</p>

                    <p>As one of two interns for a startup, I took on a big position as someone who would make significant design decisions. Weekly, we would discuss with one of the cofounders and run through new iterations of pieces of the app we designed. Given that the mobile app only had a few iterations of the MVP to begin with, I was able to design numerous pages, states, components, and iterations of the product. As my junior spring semester came to a close, I was brought on as Director of Product Design briefly to continue my work with the designs before finally parting ways.</p>

                    <p>Being left on read, misinterpreting a message, coming off as needy, admitting to ourselves we don't communicate as much as we feel we should, not knowing what to talk about... so many factors can come into play nowadays. <a href="https://thekeep.eiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3185&context=theses">Correlational analysis</a> on the relationships between text messaging and social psychology shows a significant negative relationship between self-perception of text message dependancy and self-esteem. Similarly, the study shows a positively linked correlation between text messaging and social anxiety.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With most folks, especially young adults in school or college, on their electronic devices for more than 5 hours a day during the pandemic, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617723376">study</a> shows that 48 percent of teens spending at least five hours per day on an electronic device have at least one suicide risk factor. The short story is that it's complicated, but an attachment to our devices has led to a digital "FOMO", or fear of missing out, and we see it in texting, messaging, etc.</p>

                    <p>Born out of boredom, bumpcall aims to address the consistent and ever-growing anxiety of digital communication. As an ambitious, enthusiastic, and young user experience designer, bumpcall was <b>my first opportunity into the industry as an intern</b>. At first, I felt like there was a lot riding on this, even though it was <i>unpaid</i>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond my personal desires and challenges, some initial challenges with bumpcall was the disagreement of what the bumpcall brand was to become. There was simply <b>an overwhelming amount of orange and the wireframe designs felt a bit dated</b>, so communicating suggestions for redesigns was met with resistance by the lead Product Designer who was one of the co-founders. While neither of us had formal design experience, I had collections of past designs from competitions to justify my ideas and eventually meet in the middle with the co-founder.</p>

                    <p>Upon onboarding and discussing the purpose of the product, it came to my mind that bumpcall would best serve the <b>college student population</b>, followed by students in general. This young demographic would be best suited to pitch bumpcall to because of students' daily interactions with each other, seeing each other on campus, in the hallways, libraries, dining halls, study lounges, on the sidewalks, etc. Given that isolation due to COVID-19 was one of the factors that gave rise to bumpcall, students have been one of the most impacted demographics with classes being held virtually and most colleges and universities opting out of reopening campus.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The premise of bumpcall is to bridge this loss of social interaction and communication via a spontaneous 5-minute video call to imitate that face-to-face coincidental meetup. I find that bumpcall's <b>"bump"</b> feature best fits the student culture and atmosphere due to the frequency and carefree nature of those in real-life interactions. Bumping on bumpcall is a social interaction, not a business meeting.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p><i>"What made this different from sporadically calling or FaceTiming my friends?"</i></p>
                    <p><i>"There's so many messaging platforms so are we entering a saturated market head-on?"</i></p>

                    <p>Accumulating my research together, I drafted some <i>"How might we..."</i> statements to drive the project in the right direction.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"How might we differentiate ourselves from FaceTime?"</i></p>

                    <p>When mapping out the user flow of the different routes one might take with bumpcall, it came to our attention that, like introverts and extroverts, <b>we would have users who will be making the calls and users who would receive the calls</b>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This distinction became exceptionally clear when the initial prototype had a plain spinning circle upon hitting the <b>bump button</b> in the middle. Users initiating the bump were told that they wait between 20 seconds to several minutes. That is a prime opportunity to make the most out of, but should be limited given that the wait is so variable.</p>

                    <p>Going through the entire Figma design, the first point of discussion was changing the color. With saturated oranges (and blues for a DND view), the color palette needed a makeover.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Working with orange was new for me and thus, posed a challenge to find tints and tones to compliment it without taking away the striking effect of the orange. <b>Orange is not a very popular color</b>. Orange is exciting, but can be overwhelming. <b>It signifies energy and enthusiasm, and draws attention</b>. As a result, the selection of the secondary and utility colors were chosen to be more muted colors to accentuate the orange.</p>

                    <p>Building off the new color palette, I designed several variations of the default landing screen and the DND landing screen. While the co-founder opted for the orange radial background because of its familiarity, I pushed for neutral tone base colors as the background because of <b>the higher level of contrast between the background and the CTA button — the bump</b>. Unfortunately, that suggestion was not successful.</p>

                    <p>Rather than an infinite spinning wheel overlay when clicking the bump button, I designed a series of loading screens that would not only make a wait time more enjoyable, but also <b>prompt the user to think of questions</b> along the way.</p>

                    <p>Right before departing bumpcall, another section that was under consideration was a way to gamify the product. I had come up with ideas for badges, points, and rewards but hadn't implemented them by the time I left.</p>

                    <h4 class="h4sub">How about that start-up culture?</h4>
                    <p>Taking on a role at a start-up was something else. I was a Product/UX Designer, Graphic Designer, Marketer, and more. I made iterations of logos that fell short. I created graphics for the Instagram. I designed wireframe after wireframe. Was it worth it? <b>Absolutely.</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To see your work on your phone screen as an actual part of the product, to see it interact with the user, and to get constructive feedback by other users is nothing short of remarkable. I've gone to my fair share of hackathons and designathons before, but this was a full product, with no 36-hour rush.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While it was frustrating at first to explain to one of the co-founders why the menu bar among other components couldn't all use glassmorphism or why the orange needed other colors, it was a pleasure building on my experiences both as a designer and as a leader (especially in the last few weeks post-junior spring semester).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unfortunately, all things must come to an end and my time with bumpcall was cut short as a result of decision to pursue another internship at BU Spark!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Thanks for reading!</b></p>
